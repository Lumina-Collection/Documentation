# Getting Started

## Requirements

:::info

Nameshift uses the [AxiosAPI](https://modrinth.com/plugin/axios) and requires it to be installed on your [Paper](https://papermc.io) server.

:::


| Nameshift Version  | Supported Paper Versions | Required Axios Version |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| 1.0                | 1.19.4 to 1.20.1         | 1.1.2                  |

## Installation

1. Download the required version of Axios from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/axios).
2. Download the desired version of Nameshift from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/Nameshift).
3. Place the downloaded jar files in your server's `plugins` folder.
4. Start or restart your server. ⚠️ **Do not use `/reload`, as it will not work** ⚠️

## Downloading Nameshift

Nameshift is available for download from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/Nameshift) and [GitHub](https://github.com/Lumina-Collection/Nameshift).
Modrinth is the recommended source for downloading Nameshift, as GitHub only contains minor releases (e.g. 1.0), while Modrinth contains all releases (e.g. 1.0.1).

## Configuration and Localization

As Nameshift has quite a few configuration options, you can find them on the seperate [Configuration](configuration) page.

## Updating Nameshift

Updating Nameshift is simple! Just replace the old Nameshift jar file with the new one, and restart your server. 

Remember to update Axios as well, if a new version is required!
